"Sea Battle" is a game for two participants, in which the players take turns giving the coordinates on the opponent's unknown map.
If the opponent has a ship at these coordinates (the coordinates are occupied), then the ship or its part is "sunk".
The player's goal is to be the first to sink all enemy ships.


**** Rules for placing ships (fleet) ****
The playing field is usually a 10 × 10 square for each player, on which a fleet of ships is located.
Verticals are marked with letters from left to right, and horizontal lines are marked with numbers from top to bottom.
In this case, the letters of the Latin alphabet from "A" to "J" are used.

Placed:
1 ship - a row of 4 cells ("four-deck"; battleship)
2 ships - a row of 3 cells ("three-deck"; cruisers)
3 ships - a row of 2 cells ("double-deck"; destroyers)
4 ships - 1 cell ("single-deck"; torpedo boats)

When placed, ships cannot touch each other with sides and corners.
Next to "own" field is "foreign" of the same size, only empty. This is an area of ​​the sea where enemy ships sail.
When it hits the enemy's ship, a cross is placed on a foreign field, when an empty shot is fired - 'O'.
The most vulnerable are the battleship and the torpedo boat: the former due to its large size, and therefore relatively easy to find,
and the second is due to the fact that it is drowned with one blow, although it is difficult to find it.


**** Sinking enemy ships ****
The player always moves first (since it is a complete shame to lose to my insanity - the player is given a head start).
The player making the move makes a shot - enters the coordinates of the cell in which, in his opinion, the enemy ship is located, for example, "B1".
!!Important!!
The player must enter the coordinates as follows: first, the letter of the Latin alphabet, from A to J, with a capital letter, then a number, from 1 to 10.
If the shot hits a cell that is not occupied by any enemy ship, then an "O" appears on someone else's square in this place.
The right to move passes to the opponent.
If the shot hit a cell where a multi-deck ship is located (larger than 1 cell), then an "X" appears on a foreign field in this cell.
The winner is the one who sinks all 10 enemy ships first.
